#Week 5 Chapter 5 Script - Bryce Brown



# this script will run some kernel log commands and perform some searches of dmesg and output to a file.

echo

echo Running command "cat /proc/cmdline"

cat /proc/cmdline

echo

echo Lets see if we get the same results by running a search on dmesg with "dmesg | grep Command"

echo

dmesg | grep Command



# now filter output of dmesg and append it to a file in your home directory.



echo dmesg and grep work well together but its good to remember grep is case sensitive.



cd ~

echo First search for BOOT > dmesgfilter.txt

dmesg | grep BOOT >> dmesgfilter.txt

echo Second try Boot >> dmesgfilter.txt

dmesg | grep Boot >> dmesgfilter.txt

echo Third try boot >> dmesgfilter.txt

dmesg | grep boot >> dmesgfilter.txt



cd ~

cat dmesgfilter.txt



echo All three searches should return different information.



echo Now i will perform a similar search looking for the word error and fail

echo and output it to your home directory





cd ~

dmesg | grep ERROR > dmesgerror.txt

dmesg | grep Error >> dmesgerror.txt

dmesg | grep error >> dmesgerror.txt

dmesg | grep FAIL >> dmesgerror.txt

dmesg | grep Fail >> dmesgerror.txt

dmesg | grep fail >> dmesgerror.txt
